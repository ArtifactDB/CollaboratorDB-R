# R client for CollaboratorDB

This repository contains the **CollaboratorDB** R package, which implements an R client for interacting with the [**CollaboratorDB** REST API](https://github.com/ArtifactDB/calcite-worker).
It is effectively a wrapper around the [**alabaster**](https://github.com/ArtifactDB/alabaster.base) framework for saving/loading Bioconductor objects,
combined with functions from the [**zircon**](https://github.com/ArtifactDB/zircon-R) R client to pull/save data from the **calcite** API.

See the [user's guide](https://collaboratordb.github.io/CollaboratorDB-R/articles/userguide.html) for more details.
